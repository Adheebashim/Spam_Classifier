# Spam Classifier

This is a spam classifier project built using Streamlit, Pickle, NLTK, and scikit-learn. It can be used to classify messages as spam or not spam.

To use the classifier, simply enter a message in the text area and click the "Predict" button. The classifier will then predict whether the message is spam or not spam.

## Prerequisites:

- Streamlit
- Pickle
- NLTK
- scikit-learn

### Read Me:

This project is a simple spam classifier built using Streamlit, Pickle, NLTK, and scikit-learn. It can be used to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.

The classifier works by first preprocessing the message by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stemming the words. Then, the classifier vectorizes the message using TF-IDF. Finally, the classifier predicts whether the message is spam or not spam using a machine learning model.

This project is still under development, but it can be used as a starting point for building your own spam classifier.
